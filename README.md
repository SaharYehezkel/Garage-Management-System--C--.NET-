# Garage Management System

## Project Description
This C# project is a Garage Management System. It consists of two primary components: `Ex03.GarageLogic` and `Ex03.ConsoleUI`. The project showcases advanced programming techniques in C#, focusing on object-oriented design, exception handling, and user interaction.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project demonstrates a clear separation of concerns with business logic in `Ex03.GarageLogic` and user interface in `Ex03.ConsoleUI`.
- **Complex Business Logic**: `Ex03.GarageLogic` contains the core functionalities like vehicle management (classes like `Vehicle`, `ElectricCar`, `FuelTruck`) and garage operations (`Garage` class).
- **User Interface**: `Ex03.ConsoleUI` handles user interaction and input, providing a console interface for the garage system (`GarageConsoleInterface.cs`, `GarageProgram.cs`).
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exception handling (`ValueOutOfRangeException`) to manage program flow and user input errors.
- **Enumerations and Constants**: Usage of enums (e.g., `eCarColorType`, `eFuelType`) for better code readability and maintenance.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio.
- Understanding of C# programming and .NET Framework.
- Familiarity with console applications and object-oriented programming in C#.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution file (`GarageManagementSystem.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Make sure all dependencies are properly restored.
4. Build and run the solution.

## Using the System
- Launch the application from Visual Studio.
- Navigate through the console menu to perform different garage operations like adding vehicles, checking vehicle status, etc.
- Follow the prompts to interact with the garage system.
